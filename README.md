# Image Classifier Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project is an **Image Classifier** built using **TensorFlow** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to categorize images into predefined classes, such as animals and cars, using a public dataset. The classifier is integrated with an interactive web interface, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions. This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in image recognition and offers an accessible platform for real-time image classification.
